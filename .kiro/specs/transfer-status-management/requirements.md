# Transfer Status Management Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing comprehensive transfer status management in the lanFileSharer project. The system needs to provide real-time visibility into file transfer progress, enable transfer control operations (pause/resume), and maintain transfer state across the application lifecycle.

The transfer status management system will serve as the foundation for user interface progress indicators, error recovery mechanisms, and transfer optimization features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Transfer Status Tracking

**User Story:** As a user sending files, I want to see the real-time progress of each file transfer, so that I know how much has been completed and how much time remains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file transfer begins THEN the system SHALL create a transfer status record with initial state
2. WHEN transfer chunks are sent THEN the system SHALL update the progress counters in real-time
3. WHEN a transfer completes THEN the system SHALL mark the status as completed with final statistics
4. IF a transfer fails THEN the system SHALL record the error details and failure timestamp
5. WHEN queried THEN the system SHALL provide current progress as percentage and bytes transferred

### Requirement 2: Individual File Progress Monitoring

**User Story:** As a user, I want to monitor the progress of individual files in a multi-file transfer, so that I can identify which files are taking longer or encountering issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple files are being transferred THEN the system SHALL maintain separate status for each file
2. WHEN a file transfer starts THEN the system SHALL record the start time and total file size
3. WHEN chunks are transferred THEN the system SHALL update the bytes sent counter for that specific file
4. WHEN queried for a specific file THEN the system SHALL return detailed progress information
5. IF a file transfer encounters an error THEN the system SHALL isolate the error to that file without affecting others

### Requirement 3: Overall Transfer Progress Aggregation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the overall progress of a multi-file transfer session, so that I have a high-level view of the entire operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple files are being transferred THEN the system SHALL calculate overall progress across all files
2. WHEN queried for overall progress THEN the system SHALL return total bytes sent, total bytes remaining, and overall percentage
3. WHEN files complete THEN the system SHALL update the overall progress calculation
4. WHEN calculating progress THEN the system SHALL account for files in different states (pending, active, completed, failed)
5. WHEN all files complete THEN the system SHALL report 100% completion with summary statistics

### Requirement 4: Transfer State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to pause and resume file transfers, so that I can manage bandwidth usage and handle interruptions gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transfer is active THEN the system SHALL support pausing the transfer
2. WHEN a transfer is paused THEN the system SHALL stop sending chunks and mark the state as paused
3. WHEN a paused transfer is resumed THEN the system SHALL continue from the last successfully sent chunk
4. WHEN a transfer is paused THEN the system SHALL maintain all progress information
5. IF the system restarts THEN the system SHALL be able to resume transfers from their last known state

### Requirement 5: Transfer Performance Metrics

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see transfer speed and estimated completion time, so that I can plan accordingly and identify performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transfer is active THEN the system SHALL calculate current transfer rate in bytes per second
2. WHEN calculating transfer rate THEN the system SHALL use a rolling average over the last 30 seconds
3. WHEN queried THEN the system SHALL provide estimated time remaining based on current transfer rate
4. WHEN a transfer completes THEN the system SHALL record the average transfer rate for the entire operation
5. IF transfer rate drops significantly THEN the system SHALL detect and report potential network issues

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle transfer errors gracefully and provide options for recovery, so that temporary network issues don't require restarting the entire transfer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transfer error occurs THEN the system SHALL record the error type, message, and timestamp
2. WHEN an error is recoverable THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic retry with exponential backoff
3. WHEN maximum retries are reached THEN the system SHALL mark the transfer as failed and notify the user
4. WHEN a transfer fails THEN the system SHALL preserve partial progress for potential manual retry
5. IF network connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL be able to resume failed transfers

### Requirement 7: Transfer History and Logging

**User Story:** As a user, I want to review the history of my file transfers, so that I can track what was sent, when, and to whom.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transfer session begins THEN the system SHALL create a transfer session record
2. WHEN a transfer completes or fails THEN the system SHALL persist the final status to transfer history
3. WHEN queried THEN the system SHALL provide transfer history with filtering options (date, recipient, status)
4. WHEN storing history THEN the system SHALL include file names, sizes, transfer times, and final status
5. IF storage space is limited THEN the system SHALL implement history cleanup with configurable retention period

### Requirement 8: Concurrent Transfer Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to transfer multiple files simultaneously while maintaining visibility into each transfer, so that I can maximize throughput and manage multiple operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple transfers are requested THEN the system SHALL support concurrent transfer operations
2. WHEN managing concurrent transfers THEN the system SHALL limit the number of simultaneous transfers to prevent resource exhaustion
3. WHEN a transfer slot becomes available THEN the system SHALL automatically start the next queued transfer
4. WHEN queried THEN the system SHALL provide status for all active, queued, and completed transfers
5. IF system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL prioritize transfers based on configurable criteria

### Requirement 9: Transfer Cancellation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to cancel ongoing transfers, so that I can stop unwanted operations and free up resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transfer is active or queued THEN the system SHALL support cancellation
2. WHEN a transfer is cancelled THEN the system SHALL immediately stop sending chunks and clean up resources
3. WHEN a transfer is cancelled THEN the system SHALL mark the status as cancelled with timestamp
4. WHEN cancelling a multi-file transfer THEN the system SHALL allow cancelling individual files or the entire session
5. IF a transfer is cancelled THEN the system SHALL not attempt automatic retry

### Requirement 10: Status Notification and Events

**User Story:** As a user interface component, I want to receive notifications when transfer status changes, so that I can update the display in real-time without polling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transfer status changes THEN the system SHALL emit status change events
2. WHEN components register for notifications THEN the system SHALL deliver events to all registered listeners
3. WHEN emitting events THEN the system SHALL include the file path, old status, new status, and relevant metrics
4. WHEN a component unregisters THEN the system SHALL stop delivering events to that component
5. IF event delivery fails THEN the system SHALL not block transfer operations
