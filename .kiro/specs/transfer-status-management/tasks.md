## Task Dependencies

### Critical Path

1. Tasks 1-4 (Core structures) → Tasks 5-7 (Progress tracking) → Tasks 8-10 (Sessions) → Tasks 11-13 (Events)
2. Tasks 14-16 (Error handling) can be developed in parallel with Tasks 8-13
3. Tasks 17-19 (Persistence) depend on Tasks 1-4 but can be developed in parallel with other phases
4. Tasks 20-22 (Integration) require completion of core functionality (Tasks 1-13)
5. Tasks 23-25 (Testing) should be developed incrementally alongside feature implementation
6. Tasks 26-27 (Documentation) should be completed after core functionality is stable

### Parallel Development Opportunities

- Error handling (Tasks 14-16) can be developed alongside session management (Tasks 8-10)
- Persistence (Tasks 17-19) can be developed in parallel with event system (Tasks 11-13)
