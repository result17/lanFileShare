# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create digital signature infrastructure for file structure verification





  - Implement RSA key generation and signing functionality for FileNode structures
  - Create signature verification methods to ensure file structure authenticity
  - Add cryptographic utilities for secure key handling and validation
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.5_

- [x] 2. Enhance API payload structure with signature support




  - Modify AskPayload struct to include SignedFileStructure instead of plain files array
  - Update API request/response handling to process signature verification
  - Implement signature validation in receiver's AskHandler before processing transfer request
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 3. Implement file transfer protocol with chunking mechanism
  - Create ChunkMessage protocol structures for reliable file transmission
  - Implement file chunking logic with sequence numbers and chunk hashing
  - Design message types for transfer control (data, complete, cancel, progress)
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [ ] 4. Implement sender-side file transmission over WebRTC data channels
  - Complete the SendFiles method in SenderConn using existing CreateDataChannel functionality
  - Implement file reading, chunking, and transmission logic with progress tracking
  - Add chunk-level error handling and retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.5, 4.2, 5.1, 5.2_

- [ ] 5. Implement receiver-side file reconstruction and validation
  - Create FileReceiver component to handle incoming chunks via WebRTC data channels
  - Implement chunk buffering, ordering, and file reconstruction logic
  - Integrate with existing VerifySHA256 method for file integrity validation
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5_

- [ ] 6. Add progress tracking and UI integration
  - Implement ProgressUpdate messaging system using existing uiMessages channel pattern
  - Create transfer status tracking with real-time updates for sender and receiver
  - Integrate progress events with existing app event system architecture
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.5, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 7. Implement robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
  - Add WebRTC connection state monitoring with transfer pause/resume functionality
  - Implement transfer cancellation with proper cleanup of partial files and resources
  - Create connection recovery logic for handling WebRTC disconnections during transfer
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 4.4, 5.5_

- [ ] 8. Create comprehensive test suite for file transfer functionality
  - Write unit tests for signature generation, verification, and file transfer protocol
  - Implement integration tests for end-to-end transfer scenarios with checksum validation
  - Add error scenario tests for network failures, signature verification failures, and data corruption
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation through automated testing_
