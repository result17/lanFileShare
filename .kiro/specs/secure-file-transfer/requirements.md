# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to implement a secure file transfer mechanism for systems with established WebRTC connections. The functionality will build upon existing signaling exchange and handshake processes, adding file transfer capabilities with checksum verification to ensure file integrity and digital signatures to ensure file structure consistency with requested file structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a sender user, I want to implement the actual file transfer over WebRTC data channels, so that files can be transmitted efficiently using the existing checksum infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WebRTC connection is established THEN system SHALL create data channels for file transfer
2. WHEN file transfer begins THEN system SHALL split files into chunks suitable for WebRTC data channel transmission
3. WHEN transmitting file chunks THEN system SHALL include chunk metadata (sequence number, file ID, chunk hash)
4. WHEN all chunks for a file are sent THEN system SHALL send file completion message with expected checksum
5. WHEN transfer completes THEN system SHALL verify all files using existing CalcChecksum() method

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a receiver user, I want to receive and reconstruct files from WebRTC data channel chunks, so that I can verify file integrity using existing checksum validation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving file chunks THEN system SHALL buffer and order chunks by sequence number
2. WHEN file completion message is received THEN system SHALL reconstruct complete file from chunks
3. WHEN file reconstruction completes THEN system SHALL verify file checksum using VerifySHA256() method
4. IF file checksum verification fails THEN system SHALL reject file and notify sender
5. WHEN file verification succeeds THEN system SHALL save file to designated download location

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want end-to-end encrypted file transfer with cryptographic authentication, so that file contents and structure are protected from eavesdropping and tampering during transmission.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sender prepares file transfer THEN system SHALL generate RSA-2048 key pair and AES-256 session key
2. WHEN initiating transfer THEN system SHALL perform authenticated key exchange using RSA signatures
3. WHEN transmitting file structure THEN system SHALL encrypt and sign the FileNode tree structure
4. WHEN sending file data THEN system SHALL encrypt all chunks using AES-256-GCM with unique IVs
5. WHEN receiver processes encrypted data THEN system SHALL decrypt and verify integrity using GCM authentication tags
6. IF cryptographic verification fails THEN system SHALL reject transfer and securely cleanup session keys

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time progress tracking and robust error handling during file transfer, so that I can monitor transfer status and handle failures gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file transfer begins THEN system SHALL track and display progress per file and overall transfer
2. WHEN chunk transmission fails THEN system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry mechanism
3. WHEN WebRTC connection drops THEN system SHALL attempt to re-establish connection and resume transfer
4. WHEN user cancels transfer THEN system SHALL send cancellation message and clean up partial files
5. WHEN transfer completes THEN system SHALL display summary with verification results for each file

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want encrypted file transfer to integrate seamlessly with existing WebRTC and signaling infrastructure, so that the implementation builds upon current architecture patterns while adding security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing encrypted SendFiles method THEN system SHALL use existing WebRTC PeerConnection from SenderConn
2. WHEN creating encrypted data channels THEN system SHALL use existing CreateDataChannel method in SenderConn
3. WHEN handling encrypted transfer events THEN system SHALL send updates through existing uiMessages channel pattern
4. WHEN encrypted transfer state changes THEN system SHALL integrate with existing app event system (sender/receiver packages)
5. WHEN cryptographic errors occur THEN system SHALL use existing error handling patterns with secure logging (no key material exposure)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want file transfer performance to remain acceptable with encryption enabled, so that security doesn't significantly impact usability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transferring encrypted files THEN system SHALL maintain at least 80% of unencrypted transfer speed
2. WHEN processing large files (>100MB) THEN system SHALL use streaming encryption to limit memory usage
3. WHEN handling multiple concurrent transfers THEN system SHALL efficiently manage encryption contexts
4. WHEN encryption fails THEN system SHALL provide clear error messages without exposing cryptographic details
5. WHEN transfer completes THEN system SHALL securely cleanup all cryptographic material from memory
