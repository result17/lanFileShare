# Receiver Enhancement Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification aims to enhance the file reception functionality in the lanFileSharer project's receiver component. Building upon the existing FileReceiver implementation, it adds comprehensive error handling, progress tracking, file verification, and user experience improvements to ensure reliable and user-friendly file reception processes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: File Integrity Verification

**User Story:** As a file receiver, I want the system to automatically verify the integrity of received files, so that I can ensure files were not corrupted during transmission.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file reception completes THEN the system SHALL verify file hash using existing VerifySHA256 method
2. WHEN file hash verification fails THEN the system SHALL delete corrupted file and notify sender for retransmission
3. WHEN file hash verification succeeds THEN the system SHALL retain file and send confirmation message
4. WHEN verification process encounters errors THEN the system SHALL log errors and provide clear error messages
5. WHEN receiving multiple files THEN the system SHALL independently verify integrity of each file

### Requirement 2: Reception Progress Tracking

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time progress of file reception, so that I can understand transfer status and remaining time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting file reception THEN UI SHALL display file name, size, and reception progress
2. WHEN receiving data chunks THEN system SHALL update reception progress percentage in real-time
3. WHEN receiving multiple files THEN system SHALL display current file progress and overall session progress
4. WHEN calculating transfer speed THEN system SHALL display current reception rate and estimated completion time
5. WHEN reception completes THEN system SHALL display transfer summary and verification results

### Requirement 3: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle various errors during reception process, so that I can recover or retry when problems occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving corrupted data chunks THEN system SHALL request retransmission of that chunk
2. WHEN network connection interrupts THEN system SHALL save received data and wait for reconnection
3. WHEN disk space is insufficient THEN system SHALL pause reception and notify user to free space
4. WHEN file write fails THEN system SHALL retry writing or select new storage location
5. WHEN reception times out THEN system SHALL cancel reception and clean up temporary files

### Requirement 4: File Storage Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to choose file save location and manage received files, so that I can better organize my files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting file reception THEN user SHALL be able to select save directory
2. WHEN filename conflicts occur THEN system SHALL provide rename options or automatically add suffix
3. WHEN receiving large files THEN system SHALL check disk space and warn when insufficient
4. WHEN reception completes THEN system SHALL show received files in file manager
5. WHEN user cancels reception THEN system SHALL clean up all temporary files

### Requirement 5: Multi-File Reception Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive multiple files simultaneously, so that I can improve transfer efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving multiple files THEN system SHALL maintain independent reception status for each file
2. WHEN managing file queue THEN system SHALL display reception status of all files
3. WHEN one file reception fails THEN system SHALL continue receiving other files
4. WHEN all files complete reception THEN system SHALL display complete transfer report
5. WHEN user wants selective reception THEN system SHALL allow user to reject certain files

### Requirement 6: User Interface Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want intuitive interface to monitor and control file reception process, so that I can better manage transfers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transfer request arrives THEN UI SHALL display sender information and file list for user confirmation
2. WHEN reception is in progress THEN UI SHALL display real-time progress bars and transfer statistics
3. WHEN user wants to pause THEN UI SHALL provide pause/resume reception control buttons
4. WHEN reception completes THEN UI SHALL display success message and file location
5. WHEN errors occur THEN UI SHALL display clear error messages and suggested actions

### Requirement 7: Security and Permissions

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the system to verify sender identity and control file reception permissions, so that I can prevent malicious file transfers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving transfer request THEN system SHALL verify sender's digital signature
2. WHEN detecting suspicious files THEN system SHALL warn user and provide rejection option
3. WHEN receiving files THEN system SHALL process files in secure temporary directory
4. WHEN file verification completes THEN system SHALL move files to final directory
5. WHEN detecting security threats THEN system SHALL immediately stop reception and clean temporary files

### Requirement 8: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want file reception process to be efficient and not impact system performance, so that system remains responsive when receiving large files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving large files THEN system SHALL use streaming processing to reduce memory usage
2. WHEN handling multiple concurrent receptions THEN system SHALL allocate resources reasonably to avoid blocking
3. WHEN writing to disk THEN system SHALL use buffered writing to improve performance
4. WHEN verifying files THEN system SHALL perform verification in background without blocking user interface
5. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN system SHALL automatically adjust reception parameters to maintain stability
